# Graph traversals

Visit every vertex in the graph.

## Breadth-first search

Result: BFS-tree

## Depth-first search

Result: DFS-tree

> Note: it can be used to generate mazes

# Minimum spanning tree

Spanning tree: find a tree that contains every vertex.

Minimum spanning tree: the spanning tree that minimizes some cost.

# Shortest path
