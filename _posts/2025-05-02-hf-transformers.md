Hugging Face ðŸ¤— has become a staple of LLM work.

The `transformers` library is a powerful tool for working with transformer models, providing a wide range of pre-trained models and utilities for fine-tuning and deploying them.

Problem that is solved: different models have different APIs. The `transformers` library provides a unified API for all transformer models, making it easy to switch between them without having to learn a new API each time.
