With over 13 years of experience in computational biology and applied statistics, I apply AI/ML to drug discovery, with a focus on genetics, explainable ML, and systems biology.

Prior to joining Isomorphic Labs, I served as **Systems Biology Lead** at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/science-and-technology/research-and-technology-centres/oxford-research-centre.html), where I developed solutions for target identification and maturation.

Following a double degree in Biotechnology and Biochemistry and a Master's in Bioinformatics, I specialized in **AI/ML applications to biology**, particularly [graph-based methods for genetic studies](https://pastel.hal.science/tel-03270879) (PhD at [CBIO](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr) with [Chloé-Agathe Azencott](https://cazencott.info/)) and novel AI/ML methods for feature selection (Postdoc at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) with [Makoto Yamada](https://www.oist.jp/research/makoto-yamada)). Check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tK7i7zwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [GitHub profile](https://github.com/hclimente) for more details.

I'm an advocate for reproducible research and **well-engineered** research solutions, with a focus on Nextflow pipelines. I'm detail-oriented, proactive, and wired to fix what's broken—ideally before anyone else notices.
