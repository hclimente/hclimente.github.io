As a Lead Data Scientist at Novo Nordisk, I design and deploy AI/ML methodologies for early target discovery and precision medicine — with a strong focus on genetics.

I have 13+ years of experience in computational biology and applied statistics. I completed my PhD at [CBIO](https://cbio.mines-paristech.fr), a leading bioML laboratory, under the supervision of [Chloé-Agathe Azencott](https://cazencott.info/), where I explored [graph-based methods for genetic studies](https://pastel.hal.science/tel-03270879). I then conducted my postdoctoral research at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) with [Makoto Yamada](https://www.oist.jp/research/makoto-yamada), developing novel AI/ML methods for feature selection.

My research focuses on multi-omics integration, explainable ML and systems biology. I’m an advocate for reproducible research and an advanced Nextflow developer. I’m detail-oriented, proactive, and wired to fix what’s broken — ideally before anyone notices.
